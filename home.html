        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p> Hi everyone! Currently I am a student at the University of Missouri - St. Louis. I am studying to get my Bachelor of Science
            in Computer Science. I graduated in 2019 from Illinois State University for my Bachelor of Science in Geology. 
            I am also currently attending Governors State University for my Master of Business Administration. You can say
            I have quite a lot on my plate right now. I like to code front end stuff. I have experience in Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript,
            Java, C++, and C. I plan to get more experience with React, Angular, Android Studio, and much more.
